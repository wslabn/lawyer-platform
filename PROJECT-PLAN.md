   - Test invoice status updates
   - Verify invoice details and totals

7. **Test Multi-User Scenarios:**
   - Login as different users
   - Verify user-specific data access
   - Test role-based permission differences

## Multi-Client Case Considerations ðŸ”„ NEW

### Supported Scenarios
- **Multiple plaintiffs in lawsuit** (Smith, Johnson & Wilson v. ABC Company)
- **Joint adoptions** (Husband and Wife adopting together)
- **Related but separate matters** (Trust setup 2024 â†’ Estate administration 2026)
- **Individual + group cases** (Client in both group lawsuit and personal divorce)

### Implementation Features
- **Flexible client roles** (primary, co-plaintiff, defendant, etc.)
- **Billing allocation** (split evenly, by percentage, primary client only)
- **Document permissions** (group access vs. individual confidentiality)
- **Case numbering** (practice area based: FAM2024001, LIT2024002)
- **Time allocation** (bill specific client or split among all)

### Database Relationships
- **Many-to-many**: Cases â†” Clients (via case_clients junction table)
- **Flexible billing**: Time entries can be allocated to specific clients
- **Document security**: Per-client document access permissions
- **Practice areas**: Configurable with custom codes for case numbering
- **User hierarchy**: Supervisor relationships for firm structure
- **Activity tracking**: All operations linked to performing user

### User Management & Permissions
- **Role-based defaults**: Each role gets standard permissions
- **Custom overrides**: Individual users can have modified permissions
- **Archiving policy**: No data deletion - everything gets archived
- **Flexible roles**: From solo practice (attorney + support) to complex firms
- **Permission granularity**: Control access to specific functions per user

### Known Issues & Improvements Needed
- [ ] Search functionality not implemented
- [ ] Multi-user conflict resolution needed
- [ ] Additional document templates could be added
- [ ] Invoice PDF generation not implemented
- [ ] Time tracking timer functionality missing
- [ ] Data validation could be enhanced

- [ ] Session persistence and security enhancements needed
- [ ] Password reset functionality needed

### Modification Guidelines

**Adding New Features:**
1. Update database schema in `server/models/database.js`
2. Create API routes in `server/routes/`
3. Add API methods to `electron-app/src/services/api.js`
